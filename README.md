Introduction
Purpose
The main aim of the project is to create an online book store management system that allows users to search and purchase books online based on title, author, and subject. The selected books are displayed in a tabular format, and the user can order their books online through credit card payment. This website enables users to purchase books online instead of visiting a physical bookstore, saving time and effort.

Overview
Online Book Store Management System is a web application where customers can purchase books online. Through a web browser, customers can search for a book by its title or author, add it to their shopping cart, and finally purchase using various payment methods.

Books are categorized based on subjects like fiction, nonfiction, biography, historical fiction, etc.

This project designs an online bookstore providing a web-based interface. It features a graphical user interface that allows users to input queries to search the database. The interface passes the input to a control function implemented in PHP, which processes the input, generates the search query, retrieves data from the database, and returns it to the interface. It also has bridges to search external online bookstores, generating queries based on user input and handling responses from commercial bookstores to display useful information in HTML forms.
